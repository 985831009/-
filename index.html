I really feel confused, will let us like this!
I feel you don't feel much about me.
It's better to do something more meaningful than to waste our time.
I don't have much time to talk, I'm going to graduate school, will be very busy.
I had planned to catch up with you until the Spring Festival this year, but in such a short time, I walked a lot of steps to you, but you were walking in place or even backwards, which made me feel very uncomfortable. 
Maybe I was impulsive at the beginning!
